# Module 13
Machine learning and neural networks

>Predict a successful applicant/venture/business

 
---
> This program creates a binary classifier model, using a deep neural network, that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.
---

The goal of the program is to achieve following:
* Preprocess data for a neural network model.
* Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
* Optimize the model.

## Technologies

> Program uses Python 3.10.6 version, Prophet 2.x version and Jupyter Lab

* Program uses 'Pandas' library to work with dataframes. 
* Program uses 'scikit-learn' library for scaling, encoding and train/test split 
* Program uses 'Tensorflow' and 'Keras' libraries for creating deep neural network models and work with them (fit, evaluate etc).

## Installation Guide 

Program runs in jupyter. Therefore its important to install Jupyter. If you already have installed anaconda, then you already have installed Jupyter and few relevant libraries.
Please ensure you have installed libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn before you run this program.
